        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl my-2"><span class="bg-red-300 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded ">Question 01: </span>Whatâ€™s the difference between map, foreach, filter and find?</h3>
        <div>
            <span class="bg-blue-100 text-xl px-1 font-semibold rounded-sm mb-1">Answer:</span> <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded ">Map:</span>The map method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. It returns a new array of the same length as the original array, where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element in the original array. The original array is not modified. The map method is useful when you want to transform an array into another array of the same length. <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 font-medium px-3 mr-1 rounded">Foreach:</span>The forEach method is used to apply a provided function once for each element in an array. It doesn't return a new array. The main purpose of the forEach method is to iterate over an array and execute some code for each element in the array. <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 font-medium px-3 mr-1 rounded">Filter:</span>The filter method is used to create a new array containing all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. It returns a new array that contains only the elements that fulfil the condition specified in the function. If no elements satisfy the condition, an empty array is returned. The original array is not modified. <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded">Find:</span>The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl my-2"><span class="bg-red-300 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded ">Question 02: </span>Difference between local storage, session storage and cookies?</h3>
            <span class="bg-blue-100 text-xl px-1 font-semibold rounded-sm">Answer:</span> <br>
            <div>
                There are some key differences between local storage, session storage and cookies: <br>
                <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded">Capacity:</span>
                Local storage and session storage have larger storage capacities compared to cookies. Cookies are typically limited to 4KB of data, whereas local Storage stores up to 10 megabytes and session storage stores up to 5 megabytes. <br>
                <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded">Expiration:</span>Cookies have an expiration date that can be set by the server, which determines how long the cookie will persist on the client-side. Local storage is not tied to an expiration date and will persist until it is manually cleared by the user or the developer, whereas session storage is tied to the current session of the browser and is cleared when the user closes the browser window or tab. <br>
                <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded">Accessibility:</span>Cookies can be accessed and manipulated by both the server and the client-side JavaScript code. Local storage and session storage can only be accessed and manipulated by client-side JavaScript code. <br>
                <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded"> Scope:</span>Local storage and session storage are specific to the browser window or tab that created them. This means that data stored in local storage or session storage is not accessible to other browser windows or tabs. Cookies, on the other hand, can be accessed by any window or tab that shares the same domain.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl my-2"><span class="bg-red-300 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded ">Question 03: </span>What is event loop and how does it work?</h3>
            <span class="bg-blue-100 text-xl px-1 font-semibold rounded-sm mb-1">Answer:</span> <br>
            <p><span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded">Definition:</span>The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread of execution. <br> <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded">Works:</span>The event loop works by continuously monitoring  the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

If an answer exists, it updates the answer with the new givenAns value. If not, it adds a new answer object to the answers array with the givenAns value. Then, the displayAnswers function is called to display the answers to the user on the webpage.
