            <span class="bg-blue-100 text-xl px-1 font-semibold rounded-sm">Answer:</span> <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded ">Map:</span>The map method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. It returns a new array of the same length as the original array, where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element in the original array. The original array is not modified. The map method is useful when you want to transform an array into another array of the same length. <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 font-medium px-3 mr-1 rounded">Foreach:</span>The forEach method is used to apply a provided function once for each element in an array. It doesn't return a new array. The main purpose of the forEach method is to iterate over an array and execute some code for each element in the array. <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 font-medium px-3 mr-1 rounded">Filter:</span>The filter method is used to create a new array containing all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. It returns a new array that contains only the elements that fulfil the condition specified in the function. If no elements satisfy the condition, an empty array is returned. The original array is not modified. <br>
            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-3 font-medium mr-1 rounded">Find:</span>The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
